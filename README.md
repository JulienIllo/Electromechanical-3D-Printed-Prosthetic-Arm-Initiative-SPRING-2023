Prosthetic-Arm-Initiative

Kansas State University Senior Design II Project, Electromechanical 3D Printed Prosthetic Arm Initiative SPRING 2023

Due to the extortionate price of mechanical prosthetic arms, Dr. B at Kansas State University has started an initiative to design, build, and protype an open source arm.

The Main Deliverables For SPRING 2023 were as Follows:

1. A complete model of the hand and forearm in SolidWorks.  
2. A complete set of STL files for printing the hand and arm.
3. An assembled prototype of the hand and arm.
4. A supporting controller that allows the hand to be opened and closed.  
5. Implementation of a feedback mechanism that allows the hand to grip both an egg without crushing it and a cue ball without dropping it.
6. Documentation for future development.
