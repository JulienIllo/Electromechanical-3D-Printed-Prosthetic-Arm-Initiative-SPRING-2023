# KSU2 - Prosthetic-Arm-Initiative
Kansas State University Senior Design II Project, Electromechanical 3D Printed Prosthetic Arm Initiative - Team 2


Due to the rising price of prosthetic arms, Dr. Ronald C. Brockhoff at Kansas State University has started an open source prosthetic arm initiative aimed at providing a lower cost option for those who require a prosthetic but are unable to pay the extortionate prices. As Spring '23 is the first year for this project, the focus was centered around the modeling of the parts in SOLIDWORKS and selecting initial electronics and purchased/manufactured components. The deliverables were as follows:

1. A complete model of the fingers, hand, and forearm in SolidWorks. 
2. A complete set of STL files for printing the fingers, hand, and forearm.
3. An assembled prototype of the hand and arm.
4. A supporting controller that allows the wrist to be rotated and the hand to be opened and closed.
5. Implementation of a feedback mechanism that allows the hand to grip both an egg without crushing it and a cue ball without dropping it.
6. Documentation for future development.


Thus, in this repository, you will find the models used for the final prosthetic arm. Additionally, code for an Arduino Mega 2560 - R3 MCU with the required libraries will also be provided. In tandem, a complete purchase part list will be provided for the electronics used by the research and design team. Lastly, documentation and a paper detailing the findings and devlopment of the prosthetic arm can also be found.
